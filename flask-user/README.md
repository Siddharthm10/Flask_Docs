# Flask-User
Customizable User Authentication, User Management, and more.

So, you’re writing a Flask web application and would like to authenticate your users.
You start with a simple Login page, but soon enough you’ll need to handle:
- Registrations and Email Confirmations
- Change Usernames, Change Passwords, and Forgotten Passwords

### And wouldn’t it be nice to also offer:
- Added Security
- Increased Reliability
- Role-based Authorization
- Internationalization (Chinese, Dutch, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish)
